            <h2>Photography Glossary</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the CAMshots photography glossary. This section provides definitions and explanations of common photography terms and concepts to help you better understand the technical aspects of photography.</p>
            
            <h3>Aperture</h3>
            <p>The aperture is the opening in a camera lens through which light passes to enter the camera. It is measured in f-stops (e.g., f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6). A larger aperture (smaller f-stop number) allows more light to enter and creates a shallow depth of field, while a smaller aperture (larger f-stop number) allows less light and creates a deeper depth of field.</p>
            
            <h3>Bokeh</h3>
            <p>Bokeh refers to the quality of the out-of-focus areas in a photograph. It is often used to describe the aesthetic quality of the background blur produced by a camera lens.</p>
            
            <h3>Depth of Field</h3>
            <p>Depth of field (DOF) is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a photo that appear acceptably sharp. A shallow depth of field means only a small part of the image is in focus, while a deep depth of field means most of the image is in focus.</p>
            
            <h3>Exposure</h3>
            <p>Exposure is the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor or film. It is determined by the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings. Proper exposure ensures that images are neither too dark (underexposed) nor too bright (overexposed).</p>
            
            <h3>ISO</h3>
            <p>ISO is a measure of the camera sensor's sensitivity to light. A lower ISO value (e.g., 100 or 200) is best for bright conditions, while a higher ISO value (e.g., 800, 1600) is better for low-light conditions. However, higher ISO settings can introduce noise to the image.</p>
            
            <h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
            <p>Shutter speed is the amount of time the camera's shutter is open to expose light to the camera sensor. It is measured in seconds or fractions of a second (e.g., 1/1000s, 1/250s, 1s). A fast shutter speed can freeze motion, while a slow shutter speed can create motion blur.</p>
            
            <h3>White Balance</h3>
            <p>White balance is the process of adjusting the colors in a photo to make the image look more natural. It compensates for the color temperature of the light source, ensuring that whites appear white and other colors are accurately represented.</p>
